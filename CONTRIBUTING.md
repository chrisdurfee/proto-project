## ü§ù Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment. We expect all contributors to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine on Linux)
- **Node.js 18+** for frontend development
- **Git** for version control
- **PHP 8.4+** knowledge (for backend contributions)
- **Familiarity with Proto Framework** (see [documentation](https://github.com/protoframework/proto))

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/proto-project.git
   cd proto-project
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/protoframework/proto-project.git
   ```

4. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Copy example configuration
   cp common/Config/.env-example common/Config/.env

   # Sync configuration to Docker
   ./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh sync-config

   # Start backend services
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml up -d

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd apps/main && npm install
   cd ../crm && npm install
   cd ../developer && npm install
   ```

5. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml exec web vendor/bin/phpunit

   # Check that services are running
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml ps
   ```

## üí° How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues in existing code
- **New features** - Add new functionality
- **Documentation** - Improve or add documentation
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Code quality** - Refactoring and optimization
- **Examples** - Add example modules or use cases

---

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation changes
- `test/description` - Test additions/improvements
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add or update tests as necessary
- Update documentation if needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user profile export functionality"
```

#### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication support
fix(user): resolve issue with password reset email
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(api): add integration tests for authentication
```

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

If conflicts occur, resolve them and continue:

```bash
# Resolve conflicts in your editor
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

## üìê Coding Standards

### PHP Code Standards

Follow **PSR-12** coding standards:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Opening braces for classes/methods on the same line
- Use type hints for parameters and return types
- Declare strict types: `<?php declare(strict_types=1);`

**Example:**
```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Modules\Example\Controllers;

use Proto\Controllers\ResourceController;

class ExampleController extends ResourceController
{
    public function __construct(protected ?string $model = Example::class)
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    protected function validate(): array
    {
        return [
            'name' => 'string:255|required',
            'email' => 'email|required'
        ];
    }
}
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Use ES6+ features
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Use `const` and `let` (avoid `var`)
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    return response.json();
};

// Avoid
var x = function(id) {
    return fetch('/api/users/' + id).then(r => r.json());
};
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (`UserController`, `EmailService`)
- **Methods/Functions**: camelCase (`getUserById`, `sendEmail`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (`userId`, `userData`)
- **Database Tables**: snake_case (`user_roles`, `product_categories`)

---

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in appropriate directories:
  - `common/Tests/Unit/` - Unit tests
  - `common/Tests/Feature/` - Integration tests
  - `modules/*/Tests/` - Module-specific tests

- Name test methods descriptively:
  ```php
  public function testUserCanBeCreatedWithValidData(): void
  public function testLoginFailsWithInvalidCredentials(): void
  ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml exec web vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test suite
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml exec web vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Feature

# Run with coverage
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml exec web vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/

# Run specific test file
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml exec web vendor/bin/phpunit modules/User/Tests/Feature/UserTest.php
```

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for 75%+ code coverage on critical paths
- Tests should be independent and repeatable
- Use factories for test data

**Example:**
```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Modules\User\Tests\Feature;

use Proto\Tests\Test;
use Modules\User\Models\User;

class UserTest extends Test
{
    public function testUserCanBeCreated(): void
    {
        $userData = [
            'name' => 'John Doe',
            'email' => 'john@example.com',
            'password' => 'secure_password_123'
        ];

        $user = User::create($userData);

        $this->assertNotNull($user->id);
        $this->assertEquals('John Doe', $user->name);
        $this->assertDatabaseHas('users', ['email' => 'john@example.com']);
    }
}
```
